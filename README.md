# LU01 - Binus Online Judge
This repository contains my personal solutions for the programming assignments on the Online Judge Platform for the LU01 - 1st Semester, C course at Binus University.
The primary purpose of this repository is to document my progress, practice my problem-solving skills, and serve as a personal reference for the concepts and algorithms covered in the course.

## âš  Academic Honesty Disclaimer
These solutions are for learning and reference purposes only. They represent my own effort in solving the assigned problems after learning the material.
If you are a student in the same course, I encourage you to use this repository as a tool to help you understand difficult concepts or to compare your own solutions after you have made a genuine attempt to solve the problems yourself.
Please do not copy and paste this code for your assignments. Submitting work that is not your own is a violation of academic integrity and will not help you learn the material. The goal is to become a better programmer, and that only comes with practice and struggle.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The code is organized by problem set or topic, as presented on the online judge. Each file is named according to the problem ID or title for easy navigation.
